# Smart RC Car with Bluetooth Control & Obstacle Avoidance

## Introduction
This project focuses on developing a remote-controlled vehicle using an RC car chassis, Arduino Uno, a Bluetooth module, and a mobile application. The goal was to create a smart, wirelessly controlled car that could be operated via a smartphone while integrating an object detection sensor for autonomous obstacle avoidance. By utilizing Arduino programming, Bluetooth communication, and sensor-based automation, the vehicle can respond to user commands while ensuring safety by automatically stopping when an obstacle is detected. This project demonstrates the integration of embedded systems, IoT, and basic autonomous navigation, making it a stepping stone toward more advanced robotic applications.
